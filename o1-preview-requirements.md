Okay, here's a detailed guide with specific code examples for integrating a chat application with Azure OpenAI using o1 models, based on the provided OpenAPI specification.

**I. Setup and Prerequisites:**

1. **Azure OpenAI Resource:**

   - Create an Azure OpenAI resource in your Azure subscription.
   - Note your resource's **endpoint** (e.g., `https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com`).

2. **Model Deployment:**

   - Deploy an o1 model within your Azure OpenAI resource.
   - Note the **deployment ID** you assign to your o1 model.

3. **API Key or Bearer Token:**

   - Obtain your Azure OpenAI resource's **API key** from the Azure portal.
   - Alternatively, if using Azure Active Directory authentication, set up the necessary configuration to obtain a **bearer token**.

4. **Python Environment:**
   - Make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed.
   - Install the `requests` library: `pip install requests`

**II. Basic Chat Completion with o1 Models (Non-Streaming):**

This example demonstrates a simple chat interaction without streaming.

```python
import requests
import json

# Replace with your Azure OpenAI details
ENDPOINT = "https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/openai"
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
DEPLOYMENT_ID = "YOUR_O1_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_ID"
API_VERSION = "2024-12-01-preview"

CHAT_COMPLETIONS_URL = f"{ENDPOINT}/deployments/{DEPLOYMENT_ID}/chat/completions?api-version={API_VERSION}"

HEADERS = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "api-key": API_KEY,  # Or "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
}

def generate_chat_completion(messages):
    """
    Generates a chat completion using an o1 model.

    Args:
        messages: A list of chat messages (dictionaries) conforming to chatCompletionRequestMessage.

    Returns:
        A dictionary representing the API response, or None if an error occurred.
    """
    data = {
        "messages": messages,
        "max_tokens": 500,  # Adjust as needed
        "temperature": 0.7,
        "reasoning_effort": "medium",  # o1 model specific
        "max_completion_tokens": 256,  # o1 model specific
    }

    try:
        response = requests.post(CHAT_COMPLETIONS_URL, headers=HEADERS, json=data)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return None

# Example Usage:
messages = [
    {
        "role": "developer",
        "content": "You are a friendly chatbot that answers questions accurately and concisely."
    },
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is the highest mountain in the world?"},
]

response = generate_chat_completion(messages)

if response:
    print(f"Response: {json.dumps(response, indent=2)}")
    assistant_message = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
    print(f"\nAssistant: {assistant_message}")
```

**III. Chat Completion with Streaming:**

This example demonstrates how to receive responses in a streaming fashion.

```python
import requests
import json

# ... (ENDPOINT, API_KEY, DEPLOYMENT_ID, API_VERSION, HEADERS are the same)
CHAT_COMPLETIONS_URL = f"{ENDPOINT}/deployments/{DEPLOYMENT_ID}/chat/completions?api-version={API_VERSION}"

def generate_chat_completion_stream(messages):
    """
    Generates a chat completion using an o1 model with streaming.

    Args:
        messages: A list of chat messages (dictionaries).

    Yields:
        Chunks of the streamed response.
    """
    data = {
        "messages": messages,
        "max_tokens": 500,
        "temperature": 0.7,
        "reasoning_effort": "high",  # Example of using high reasoning effort
        "max_completion_tokens": 256,
        "stream": True,  # Enable streaming
    }

    try:
        response = requests.post(CHAT_COMPLETIONS_URL, headers=HEADERS, json=data, stream=True)
        response.raise_for_status()

        for line in response.iter_lines():
            if line:
                decoded_line = line.decode("utf-8")
                if decoded_line.startswith("data:"):
                    chunk = decoded_line[6:]  # Remove "data: "
                    if chunk.strip() == "[DONE]":
                        break
                    yield json.loads(chunk)
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Example Usage:
messages = [
    {
        "role": "developer",
        "content": "You are a helpful assistant that explains complex topics in simple terms.",
    },
    {"role": "user", "content": "Explain the concept of artificial intelligence to me."},
]

for chunk in generate_chat_completion_stream(messages):
    # print(f"Received chunk: {chunk}")
    if "choices" in chunk:
      for choice in chunk["choices"]:
          if "delta" in choice and "content" in choice["delta"]:
              print(choice["delta"]["content"], end="", flush=True)

```

**IV. Handling o1 Model Specific Parameters:**

- **`reasoning_effort`:**

  - Experiment with different values (`low`, `medium`, `high`) to see the impact on response quality and latency.
  - Consider using `low` for faster responses where deep reasoning is not critical.
  - Use `high` for tasks that require more complex reasoning, but be prepared for potentially slower response times.

- **`max_completion_tokens`:**
  - Set this parameter to limit the total tokens generated by the model, including those used for reasoning.
  - This can help control costs and prevent the model from generating excessively long responses.
  - Remember to account for both the visible output and reasoning tokens when setting this value.

**V. Advanced Usage:**

1. **Adding `data_sources`:**

   - If you want to integrate your model with Azure data sources like Azure Cognitive Search or Cosmos DB, you'll need to configure the `data_sources` parameter in your request.
   - Refer to the OpenAPI specification section on `azureChatExtensionConfiguration` for detailed information on how to structure this parameter.

2. **Using `tools` and `tool_choice`:**

   - The `tools` parameter lets you define functions the model can call. For o1, at this time, this is only `functions`.
   - `tool_choice` gives you control over how the model uses those functions.
   - Refer to the specification for the correct structure of the `tools` and `function` objects.

3. **Error Handling:**

   - Implement robust error handling in your application to gracefully handle API errors, network issues, and unexpected responses.

4. **Conversation Management:**
   - Your application will need to manage the conversation state by storing and updating the `messages` array as the conversation progresses.

**VI. Tips for o1 Models:**

- **Experiment:** The best way to find the optimal settings for `temperature`, `top_p`, `reasoning_effort`, and other parameters is to experiment and see how they affect the model's responses in your specific application.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Carefully craft your prompts (both `developer` and `user` messages) to guide the model towards the desired behavior. Provide clear instructions and context.
- **Monitor Usage:** Keep track of your token usage to avoid unexpected costs.
- **Stay Updated:** The Azure OpenAI service is constantly evolving. Stay informed about new features and updates by referring to the official documentation.

This guide, along with the code examples, will help you get started with integrating your chat application with Azure OpenAI using o1 models. Remember to adapt the examples to your application's specific requirements and explore the full capabilities of the API by referring to the OpenAPI specification.
